# Introduction

In the 7th quarter of the study Computer Science at Avans University of Applied Sciences, students are tasked to make a retro game based on a FPGA. In this document, the architectural choices are described. This document structures the design to accomplish the desired output which is described in the [game design document](https://jjtbm-games.github.io/design/gamedesign).
