# Introduction

In the 7th quarter of the study Computer Science at Avans University of Applied Sciences, students are tasked to make a retro game based on a FPGA. In this document, the architectural choices are described. This document structures the design to accomplish the desired output which is described in the [game design document](https://jjtbm-games.github.io/design/gamedesign). 

# Controls (buttons)

# Visuals

The goal in this paragraph is to clarify choices specific to the visual representation of Ram Race. The game must by visually appealing to ensure the best game experience for the end-users.

In this paragraph an initial setup, all criteria, and considered options are given to create a solid framework. Finally the necessary architecture is given in the form of UML diagram(s). 

## Initial setup



## Criteria 

| Index | Criteria    | Explanation                         |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1.0   | sprite size | must be smaller or equal to 32 bits |
| 2.0   |             |                                     |



## Options 

## Choices 

## Architecture 

notes: 

* pixels size, 
* sprites vs vector, 
* designer(broertje tim),
* name selector(key board),
* scoreboard design, 
* level design, 
* menu design

# Logic 

notes:

*  static grid vs dynamic grid(rendering time), 
*  collision handling, 
*  audio playback, 
*  character movement(hold switch), 
*  menu flow, 
*  game flow
